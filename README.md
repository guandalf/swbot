# Sword &amp; Wizardry Discord companion

Discord helper bot (and possibly more) to play Swords &amp; Wizardry.

## Project

This project is initially based on the guide at this url:

  <https://discordjs.guide/>

The goal would be to have a helper to play Sword &amp; Wizardry sessions on a Discord server.

## TODO

Almost everything, but as priorities I think:

* agree on a data storage backend and library to interface with
* agree on a service (free) to run the bot on
